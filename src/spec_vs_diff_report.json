  "summary": "The diff implements all 6 requirements for fixing backend video finalization and persistence. Backend changes add the isPersistent flag, explicit error handling (though limited logging), and memory checks. Frontend changes add timeout detection (30s), error handling with retry buttons, and persistence verification in Home.tsx. However, some implementation details are incomplete or not fully visible due to truncation.",
