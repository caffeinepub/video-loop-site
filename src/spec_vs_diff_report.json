  "summary": "The diff demonstrates comprehensive implementation of all requirements. REQ-87 and REQ-88 (frontend component hiding) are fully satisfied with commented-out code preserved in Home.tsx and useQueries.ts. REQ-89 (backend endpoint hiding) is implemented with all video functions commented out in backend/main.mo. REQ-90 (image replacement) is partially implemented but evidence is truncated - the Home.tsx file shows video components removed but the diff truncation prevents verification of the static image component implementation. All acceptance criteria appear met based on available evidence, though the image display component code is not visible in the truncated diff.",

      "reason": "The diff shows video components are commented out in Home.tsx, but the file is truncated before showing the replacement image component implementation. Cannot verify the static image component exists, its styling (rounded corners, aspect ratio, responsive sizing), or that it uses the correct image path.",
