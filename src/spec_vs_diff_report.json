  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive backend optimizations for video finalization including error handling, performance logging, storage validation, and chunk assembly logic. All five requirements (REQ-87 through REQ-91) are addressed with detailed implementations in backend/main.mo. A migration module was added to handle data structure changes. Frontend hooks were modified to support the enhanced backend functionality.",
